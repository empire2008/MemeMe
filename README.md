# MemeMe

This is my second project that I studied on Udacity course.

The MemeMe is the application to add meme to a photo and save to library.

STEP
1. Open application
2. Select a photo from library or take a photo via camera
3. Tap on the input field on the top or bottom then type some words
4. You can also share and save to your libraty via activity button
5. The photos that saved will also show on the list view that you are able to change the meme content or re-save it
